Dude, just walked out of Death of a Unicorn and my brain's still like a blender on high speed. Theater was packed tighter than a can of sardines and those seats — I swear they're modeled after medieval torture devices. Back's gonna need some yoga or a miracle to unknot.

So the movie... wow. It's like, imagine if David Lynch and Wes Anderson had a love child raised on energy drinks. First scene, there's this unicorn, right? But it's not, like, sparkly and majestic. More like a punk rock unicorn with a mohawk made of lightning. It just bursts through the screen — or maybe that’s just the popcorn fight happening in the row behind me.

> And the sound, man, it’s like someone mixed Led Zeppelin with whale sounds. It’s half amazing, half like being underwater on another planet. I can't even remember what dialogue was because of that constant crunching from the kid with an endless popcorn bucket next to me.

Halfway through, there's this scene where the unicorn, who btw is also a sad office worker somehow? — flies over a city that looks like it’s made of melting rainbows, who even comes up with this stuff??? Realized I still have no idea what the plot was supposed to be — but I felt all the weird emotions. Rage, hope, boredom, the whole buffet. Watch the movie for the feels, expect your brain to take a hike.

My phone buzzed, tonight's that party but I can't stop thinking of this one moment... the unicorn made a sound kinda like an electric guitar crying, wild! I was gonna download the movie but after this first encounter I feel like watching it again would be like trying to hold onto a dream you half-remember.

Also, that actor who plays the unicorn’s human alter ego? He’s like if James Franco and a golden retriever morphed, comforting but like, kinda unpredictable. Hope he's not CGI but at this point, who can tell? Screen was so blurry from the guy two seats over fiddling with some weird laser pointer flashlight thing.

Oops, I just realized my coffee shop shift starts in five hours. Gonna be pulling espresso shots while dreaming of unicorn rain and mohawk magic.

  console.log(fly! gallop! rave!);
